Hi there! I'm Nikolas, and I'm deeply invested in understanding the world through the lens of technology and artificial intelligence. I enjoy reading a good book and spending long nights coding. My journey into AI began when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, as I saw the potential for AI to be used for good and help address global challenges.

This blog is primarily a space for me to document my learning process and share insights on AI and related topics. If you find the content useful, feel free to use it and join me on this journey of exploration and discovery.
